## Volunteering for Geo Bharat

### Available roles

- Social Media manager - Social media such as linkedIn, twitter, Facebook are essential parts of life now a days, we want someone who will make sure that our announcements , events, etc. cross platforms. 
- Event planners/host - We want to make Geo Bharat self sustainable, the key part of this goal is to allow more people to host events independently. So If you love to talk to people and host our monthly webinars, workshops, etc. We want you!
